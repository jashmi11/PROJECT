# Netflix Recommendation Engine

A machine learning project that predicts and recommends movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history.



## Introduction

The Netflix Recommendation Engine is a system that leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. By analyzing user data and movie attributes, this project aims to enhance the user experience by suggesting movies that align with individual preferences.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies by analyzing user behavior and similarities with other users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies based on the attributes of movies previously liked by the user.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for users to get recommendations.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing user ratings and movie information. The dataset includes:
- User IDs
- Movie IDs
- Ratings
- Movie titles
- Movie genres
